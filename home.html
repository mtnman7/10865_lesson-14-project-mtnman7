			<h1>US Veteran Support</h1>
			<p>The need to help US veterans arises from the significant challenges they often face after their military service. 
			Veterans may grapple with physical disabilities, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), unemployment, and homelessness. 
			According to a report by the National Coalition for Homeless Veterans (2020), over 37,000 veterans experienced homelessness in 2019. 
			These brave individuals sacrificed their well-being to protect our nation, and it is our responsibility to offer them support in return. 
			Assisting veterans in accessing healthcare, mental health services, job training, and affordable housing is crucial to help them reintegrate into civilian life successfully. 
			Addressing the needs of US veterans not only honors their service but also contributes to building a stronger and more compassionate society.
