			<h1>About Me</h1>
			<p>My name is Troy Rosenow and I am the son of a US Army Veteran. My father served in Germany during the Vietnam War. My ex-Father-In-Law served in the US Navy during World War II. 
			Caring for our veterans is a topic that is extremely important to me. These people put their lives on the line to protect us in ways we never have to experience ourselves. 
			It is unfortunate that many American citizens take their freedom for granted. Regardless, there are many ways in which one can help our veterans. I hope you find my website helpful in that regard.
